[Intro: LayZ]
Started as a dream and a wishlist
To be the coolest geek in the business
Presents for the nephews and nieces
Now it's back to mum and dads for the feasting

[Chorus: LayZ]
Singing Merry, Merry Christmas
If you ain't got a present that's your business
We got everything and more on the wishlist
Singing Merry, Merry

[Verse 1: Behzinga & Jme]
See, in Christmas time, I get hashtag Merky (Merky)
Moving like Mike with my Christmas turkey (Bakaw)
Harry got the snow (Ayy), Jamie got the flow (What?)
Shakka on the beat (Ayy), KSI got teets (Teets)
Why the hell you bulkin' up for Christmas? Look at you (Fatty)
Dumb KSI got stuck in the chimney shoot (Fatty)
We got Christmas on the beat, Santa in the sheets (Ayy)
It's not my fault Mrs. Claus wants the D (Trust)

[Verse 2: Jme]
Mrs. Claus
Ethan's got her on all fours
None of your wives are safe (No)
Disrespect and he'll pull yours
S-X, 'Mr-Top-Ten', yeah
Round of applause
Change style Rudeboy
Jme is just all shorts (All shorts)
Before, war are you all sure?
Man's a ryzen threadripper
You're Pentium Dual Core
Rock jaws
Sleep, snore, on the cold floor
While you drown in the war
Man will just row to the shore
[Verse 3: W2S & Jme]
Merry Christmas KSI, you silly buffoon
Yeah, you got a top ten
But you're the worst on the tune
You can't multiply and you can't do division
Pipe down, you only won a split decision
I'll be coming at you with some Christmas banter
I heard Tobjizzle got nonced by Santa (nonced)
I took a look at Zerkaa's Christmas list
Can you imagine my surprise when I saw it said kids
All the cousins round for Christmas dinner, enjoying life
And Vik's trying to pick one out to be his next wife
Happy holiday Simon, my old chum
The only turkey getting stuffed this year, is your mum (Haha, your mum)

[Bridge: Jme]
Jingle bells, Simon smells
Josh is a eedyat
Tobi's a wasteman
JJ, no we don't take no L's
S-X, 'Mr-Top-Ten'
You man tried it, but you all failed
You man are shit, I'm bringing in Vik
Man are gonna elbow drop some elves

[Verse 5: Vikk & Jme]
See we're all young guys, got Christmasses to come
And you're just OAP's, might not make the next one
Me and Behz on PUBG (Ey), getting chicken dinner
But your boy slim Simon's just getting thinner
Yeah Rudolph's nose is red and Harry's is white
We're waiting on an upload, but he's high as a kite (High as a kite)
Yeah he's up there, do a quick flyby Santa's chairStone cold stun a man in mid air
Take a few boxes it's not fair, but we don't care
[Chorus: Jme & LayZ]
We're still singing Merry, Merry Christmas
If you ain't got a present that's your business
We got everything and more on the wishlist
Singing Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
Singing Merry, Merry Christmas
If you ain't got a present that's your business
We got everything and more on the wishlist
Singing Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
