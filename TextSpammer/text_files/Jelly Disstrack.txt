[Intro]
Yo, heh-heh, heh-heh-heh-heh
Kwebbelkop, Slogoman, you ready for this?

[Verse 1]
Fuck you Kwebbelkop
Sucking on a red baby bottle pop
'Bout to treat this hoe like a lab rat
So skinny you can fit between an ass crack
Be-Beat him on the game and he still uptight
Can't hold a sip of his Miller Lite
Speak of my K-Swiss, it's a problem
My shoelace cleaner than your whole damn closet
Talk that shit like you rich in profit
You livin' with me, but you diggin' in garbage
You can't even deal with my hot ass bars
You don't have a license to drive a car with
Your so called "Kops" rather be on Jelly side
Calling 911, emergency
Keep Jelly out yo' mouth Mr. Kwebbelkop
And stick to cryptocurrency

[Chorus]
All I hear is Jelly this, Jelly that, fake cop throwing stones
Woke up to trash talk, now you got me in my zone
Shame I gotta' slap you back in ya' lane, tryna to swerve mine
That'll get you owned, Kwebbelkop just got pwned
Slogoman go get gone
[Verse 2]
Beast awoken, Slogoman you so fat an bogus
Show us all what broke is, blowin' money fast
Couldn't buy me a new toothbrush, even when he broke it
Facts, nothin' more than an ogre, always late you a lazy bozo
Oh no, the man named Slogo, moving slo-mo, ya gaming so-so
I laugh fully at the bully
Ain't doing shit but acting silly
The slug in ya' pic is a great depiction
Drooling slow, always raid the kitchen
Say you the best, but your breath is kickin'
For the record, you less than lesser
Hit the floor you might shake the dresser
Can't fit through double doors on a stretcher
And I see, you can't stand by me, you can't handle the NYC
On the couch where ya steady sleepin'
Why you gotta keep ya' girl a secret
Raise the red flag, forfeit fast
Hate, that I just had to scorch ya' ass
But a slug like you 'bout as good as trash
You can't even do basic math

[Chorus]
All I hear is Jelly this, Jelly that, fake cop throwing stones
Woke up to trash talk, now you got me in my zone
Shame I gotta' slap you back in ya' lane, tryna to swerve mine
That'll get you owned, Kwebbelkop just got pwned
Slogoman go get gone
[Outro]
Kwebbelkop you just got owned, son, that's right I called you son
Oh Slogo, oh Slogo, Slogoman go get gone
